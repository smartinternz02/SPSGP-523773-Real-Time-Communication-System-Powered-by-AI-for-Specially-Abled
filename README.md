PROJECT INTRODUCTION Sharing ideas, thoughts, and experiences with folks in one's local vicinity helps people get to know one another. There are several ways to do this, but the giϔ of "Speech" is by far the most powerful. Speech makes it possible for all people to understand and effectively convey their views. Not considering those deprived of this wonderful giϔ—the dumb and the deaf—will be unfair. In these circumstances, human-hand touch has continued to be the primary mode of communication. Things that were formerly difficult or impossible for persons with disabilities to obtain are now frequently available to them and are simple for them to access. People with disabilities can now live in a society where their difficulties are recognized and taken into account thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). Technology can now adapt and change the globe to make it a more open society thanks to technological breakthroughs. As AI directly correlates with humans, including those with and without disabilities, there is a certain sensation of being human.To create a model trained on different hand motions, we use are using a convolution neural network and deep learning. Based on this model, an app is created with the help of which a person who is deaf or dumb can communicate using postures that are translated into speech and human-understandable words.
